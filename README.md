> [!NOTE]
> Any public repository under this profile licensed to Jim Philip, where the license year is out of date by **2 or more years**, may be regarded as **public domain**. This ensures that if a repository becomes inactive or abandoned, the code can still be fully open and usable by others.
>
> If the license year is later updated after the repository has entered the public domain, the repository will **revert to its original license** and will no longer be considered inactive or abandoned. However, this does not permanently prevent it from becoming public domain again. If no further updates are made for another **2 years**, it will once again be regarded as **public domain**.
>
> Any use or distribution of the code that occurred while the repository was considered public domain **remains valid**. However, once the repository reverts to its original license, any new use or distribution must comply with the updated license terms.
>
> **Example (in 2025):**
>
> - `Copyright (c) 2022-2024 Jim Philip` – _Not yet public domain (eligible in 2026)_
> - `Copyright (c) 2022-2023 Jim Philip` – _Now public domain (license not updated for 2 years)_
